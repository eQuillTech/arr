When I try to add my submodule using
git submodule add https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/tlbx.git tlbx

it says
fatal: A git directory for 'tlbx' is found locally with remote(s):
  origin        https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/tlbx.git

But I can't find this repository locally. How can I remove it and re-add the submodule from the remote source?
