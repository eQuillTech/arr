When I try to add my submodule using
git submodule add https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/tlbx.git tlbx

it says
fatal: A git directory for 'tlbx' is found locally with remote(s):
  origin        https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/tlbx.git

But I can't find this repository locally. How can I remove it and re-add the submodule from the remote source?

Can I tell Xcode to display my .tem files with .cpp formatting?

For Method 2, I don't see "File Type" in Build Settings.

Can you use a wildcard, for example *.tem", instead of listing each file?

Can I use automatic syntax coloring for CMakeLists.txt files in Xcode?

How do I make automatic syntax coloring work in VS Code so that .tem files are displayed as .cpp?

This message pops up every time I run either arr_tests or examples.
“arr_tests” would like to access files in your Documents folder.
 Can you make it go away?

When I called "cmake .." from within the build folder, there was no arr.xcodeproj generated.

cmake -G Xcode ..

How can I auto-set the ${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_TESTING CMake variable to TRUE, when first building the project?

Do I need to set ${PROJECT_NAME}, as in ./CMakeLists.txt and ./tlbx/CMakeLists.txt? Is ${PROJECT_NAME} defined when I call project("project_name")?

I want the path to googletest to depend whether tlbx is the main project, or a submodule.
If tlbx is a submodule (e.g., of arr), I don't want to "add_subdirectory(googletest)" within ./tlbx/CMakeLists.txt.
Is there a way to do that?
